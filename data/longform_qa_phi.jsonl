These blocks represent the Soviet Union, which was like a very big country with 15 other smaller countries inside it. Imagine there's a giant wizard named Gorbachev who wants to make things better in the Soviet Union. He decides to dissolve, or break apart, the big stack into smaller blocks, and even give some blocks to other friends.\n\nSounds fun, but not everything goes according to plan. Some blocks start to fall into pieces without the wizard's control, adding to the mess. Also, there are some rulers and common people who don't want to let the Soviet Union disappear. They argue, and suddenly, the big stack can't stay together.\n\nJust like magic wizards, sometimes, economies in places like the USA, which is another big powerful country, can face problems too. If we keep the same lessons from the tomb from before, and the USA doesn't take care of these issues, then in the future it might also find itself needing to change to become better, or maybe even need to find a new way to be a powerful friend to its neighbors. It's not that it's a sure thing, but remember, stories often have unexpected twists and turns!"}
{"instruction": "how do we diferentiate the frequency of a note from the sound that characterize a certain instirment ? Why can I tell an A on a cello apart from an A on a piano ? Please explain like I'm five.", "input": "", "output": "Imagine you have paper airplanes made out of different colored paper. They are all called a \"plane,\" but they look different and fly in different ways because they are made from different materials. Now, think about your voice. When you sing or talk, you create sounds. The different \"sounds\" that make up music are like those paper airplanes. They are all part of a musical piece, but they look, feel, and sound differently because of the way the instrument \"flies\" them - this \"flies\" them through its design and how it produces sound.\n\nLet's use the A notes on the cello and the piano to explain this. When you press the A note on the cello, it's like unrolling a colorful, long paper airplane. It takes more pressure and a longer part of your body to press and release that A. This long-time \"flight\" creates a rich, warm, and gentle \"sound\" that fills the air with a feeling of softness and depth, like a big, cozy blanket. \n\nOn the other hand, on the piano, pressing the A note is like quickly unrolling a short paper airplane. Your finger only needs to press a small area for a very short time. This quick \"flight\" creates a bright, high, and strong \"sound\" that reaches your ears quickly, like a small energy bouncing back.\n\nSo, even though both notes are called \"A\" and are in the same instant, the notes have different \"frequencies\" and \"sounds\" because of the \"instruments\" (the cello and the piano) that \"fly\" them. The frequency is like how fast or slow we \"fly\" the paper airplanes, and the sound is like how the airplane looks and feels - either soft and cozy from the cello or bright and energetic from the piano."}
{"instruction": "Could someone explain LI5 ' The Catcher in the Rye ' and why it 's so controversial ? also maybe why it 's related to John Lennon 's death ? Explain like I'm five.", "input": "", "output": "'The Catcher in the Rye' is a story about a young boy named Holden Caulfield. He's very unhappy and feels sad for a lot of reasons. Holden doesn't like how adults sometimes pretend to be nice, but really they're not. He also misses his older sister who moved away, and he feels left out because he doesn't understand the world around him as much as other people his age do.\n\nThe book is controversial because some people think it's too honest and shows a lot of negative feelings. They worry that talking about these topics might make young people, like you and your friends, think that it's okay to be unhappy. However, others believe that the book is important because it helps people understand the struggles young people go through, and it encourages them to talk openly about their feelings.\n\nAs for the connection to John Lennon's death, it's because some people think Holden Caulfield figured out that life isn't always easy and felt very sad. When John Lennon was killed, some people said that Holden Caulfield was the 'phantom' mentioned in a song he wrote. That song, which goes like, \u201cI am the Walrus,\u201d was about a character that felt lost and confused, just like Holden does.\n\nSo, to explain this simple, 'The Catcher in The Rye' is a story about a boy who feels sad and confused about the world. Its controversial because people have different opinions about it, and it's connected to John Lennon's death because some people believe that a character in the book seemed a bit like John, who was also sad when something bad happened to him."}

You can't tell what Mood Daisy is in until you look at Bella. That's what physicists analyze in Quantum entanglement.\n\nNow, in real life, physicists entangle particles by using Photons or Particles that glow like little suns (these are called lasers). They shine these lasers simultaneously and zap the particles with them. This makes the particles entangle just like Daisy and Bella. And once they are entangled, knowing the state of one automatically tells us the state of the other, even if they're far away.\n\nGive it a thought, is that not magical?"}

Well, heavy water is like that but even more special because it has an extra thing called \"deuterium\" that makes it heavier. \n\nThe Nazis wanted to make something very powerful called an atomic bomb, and to do this, they needed a special ingredient called \"uranium.\" But they couldn't get enough uranium by themselves, so they decided to trick it. They were trying to cook it with heavy water in a way that would make it explode really, really powerfully. \n\nNormal water doesn't work for this tricky recipe because the heavy water brought in extra weight to the process. Normal water is like a fast cheetah - light and fast. Heavy water is like a slow but strong elephant - it's slow, but it can carry a lot of weight. \n\nSo, the Nazis were interested in heavy water because they could use its extra weight (deuterium) to help them make their atomic bomb. It was a bit like following a secret recipe to make a big, super powerful cake! But remember, this is a serious topic, and the Nazis were nefarious people who were causing a lot of harm. Always remember that it's crucial to use science and technology for good, like helping people and taking care of our planet!"}

Every hero you play, like Radiant Silver Knight or Undertaker, has their special abilities to help the team.\n\nNow let's talk about those custom maps (called \"gametypes\") you mentioned. \"Custom maps\" are like setting up a new city in Minecraft, but even better! A smaller group of people put together a new map with new buildings, rules, and maybe even a bit of creativity that can give the game a totally fresh feel.

Sleeping medicines, like Ambien and Restoril, are like special helpers that come in to quiet down the city and make it easier for you to drift off to sleep.\n\nSometimes, these \"special helpers\" work well and make the city really quiet and calm, and you end up sleeping like a baby. But other times, it's like they can't calm down the city completely, and that's why you're still a bit wide awake or don't seem to fall asleep much.\n\nA few things can make them work better or worse. For example, eating a big meal right before might make it harder for them to do their job, because your body is busy digesting instead of settling down to sleep. It's like the city still has construction going on even after the \"special helpers\" arrive.\n\nAlso, every person is unique, kind of like how every city has different people and activities. What works well for one person may not work as well for another. So what you see as \"wildly inconsistent\" might just mean your \"city\" has different needs at different times."}

Some kids bang their drums really hard, and some don't hit them much at all.\n\nNow, think that each kid's drum sound is like a mystery ingredient. The _Fourier Series_ and _Fourier Transforms_ are like super-smart detectives. They can break down all those sounds (or 'mystery ingredients') into different levels\u2014slow, medium, and fast beats. Once they do this, kids can mix those ingredients back to make any sound they want, even if it's not from a drum!\n\nSo the 'Fourier Series' is a tool that helps us understand and break down different sounds into their slices. And 'Fourier Transforms' does a similar job but in a sort of math magic way.\n\nHere's a simple example:\n\n1. Someone plays a song on a drum, with lots of different beats.\n2. The detective `Fourier Series` looks at these beats and breaks them down. It finds that this song has:\n   - Slow beats (like walking slowly in the park) \n   - Medium beats (like running in the park)\n   - Fast beats (like running as fast as you can in the park)\n3. Now, let's say we have another kid at the playground who can't play a full song.

You all have different jobs to do. You're in charge of gathering everyone's ideas, another friend handles designing the fort, and someone else takes care of finding materials. \n\nYour parents might give you money to buy the necessary materials. In this case, think of your parents' money as being like a 'trust fund'. A trust fund is when someone gives something, like money, to support a person, group, or cause, usually when they've already made enough money to take care of themselves.\n\nNow, there could be a secret or a 'loophole' in how your parents manage their money, which is like the fort project. Some people with money to give, or a 'trust fund,' might still get more money or even work, like you and your friends. This could happen if the person managing the 'trust fund' or 'project' spends all the money or if they use it to help others who shouldn't be getting money because they haven't been working yet. It's like if someone uses all the building materials before you, or even gives some to people who aren't part of your team.\n\nPresident Obama talked about a trust fund loophole in a similar way, mentioning that some people with money from their 'trust fund' might still be working, taking advantage of the extra money they are supposed to have all set aside for when they retire (like when you grow up and can't do playground activities anymore). He's saying that it's important for people to contribute and work to keep society strong and fair, just like you and your friends all pitching in to make the fort great."}

It's like playing a game of \"hot and cold\" to find out where things are happening in the city that need attention.\n\nWhen someone says, \"There's trouble at this address\" over the radio, the dispatcher - a person who speaks with the radio - writes down that information and looks at a map to figure out where it is. Then, using that map, the dispatcher decides which officer should go to where to handle the situation. They aim to choose the officers who are the quickest to reach the spot, whether it's an old man needing help or people causing disturbances.\n\nIn some cases, too many people at one spot need this fast-action team, so they call in extra police, like a special squad from another area. This team is there specifically trained and ready to fix big problems quickly.\n\nAfter everything is sorted and dispatched, that office talk or description of the problem makes it onto the police radios, now reaching all the officers. That's how they all get the vital details - where they need to be and what they need to do! This system helps keep everything organized even when a lot of unexpected things are happening at once."}

The shooter is the person rolling the dice, and the other players are cheering and choosing bets.\n\n2. Dice: Craps is played with two dice. They look like dice you'd roll in Monopoly, but they are made of plastic or wood and have different numbers on each side.\n\n3. Numbers to win: In Craps, you aim to roll one of the following numbers: 7 or 11 (to win with \"natural\"). You can also roll your first roll number, called the \"point\". That number decides how the game continues.\n\n4. First roll: When the shooter rolls the dice for the first time, they can either win with a \"natural\" (a 7 or 11) or lose if they roll a 2, 3, or 12 (this is called \"crapping out\"). If they roll the first roll number (4, 5, 6, 8, 9, or 10), they now become the point number until they roll a 7 or reach the original point number again.\n\n5. Rolling \"the point\": If the shooter rolls their first roll number (the \"point\" number) again, they win and the game ends. But if they first roll a 7, they lose or \"seven-out\".\n\n6. Rolling a 7: If the shooter rolls a 7 before rolling their \"point\" number again, they lose the game. It's like saying a 7 is a big red stop sign that needs to be avoided.\n\n7. Placing bets: Before the first roll, players can bet on who they think will win - the shooter or the players. They can say, \"I bet on the field\" if they think the shooter wins or \"I bet on the pass\" or \"I bet on the don't pass\" if they think the shooter rolls their \"point\" number first.\n\n"}

EDIT : Thanks for your helpful answers , guys ! Explain like I'm five.", "input": "", "output": "Alright kiddo, here's a simple way to understand how airplanes can fly upside down. Do you remember stacking your building blocks and seeing how they don't fall off the table even when turned upside down? Plane wings are like those blocks.\n\nThe wing of the plane is shaped a bit like a duck's foot, called an airfoil. When the plane flies, air moves faster over the top of the wing than it does under the bottom. This is because there's more distance to travel, and faster flow can only happen quicker. This creates a sucking force that lifts the plane up. That's called \"lift,\" and it helps planes go up in the sky.\n\nWhen the plane flips upside down, it's still tilted a little, so some of the air still goes faster over the top than under the bottom of the wings, creating lift again. So the plane can continue to fly even when it\u2019s upside down!\n\nRemember, pilots (drivers of the plane) make sure the airplane flies this way for safety. Your grown-ups fluffing the plane, they'll tell you if they want the plane to stay right side up!"}

But some cameras are like your special-eyed dog and have some extra tricks up their sleeve, making them more expensive. \n\nHere's how:\n\n1. **Focusing:** Some cameras are super fast at focusing on what you want to take a picture of, almost like your dog far-seeing abilities. It's like when your dog spots a bright ball and quickly jumps over it.\n\n2. **Quality:** Some cameras take pictures in far, far more detail, just like how your dog's eyes take in many more details of its environment. These cameras are like having your dog see Johnny's tie in the crowd, not just the crowd itself!\n\n3. **Stability:** Some cameras are built to be more steady when taking pictures, like a rock in a lake, while others might shake a little, like a leaf. It's like if your dog becomes so excited, it starts wagging its tail and barking, while your special dog friend's goggles keep him still and focused.\n\n4. **Features:** Some super-expensive cameras have more 'special tools' or 'gadgets' to make them easier to use - sort of like how your dog\u2019s goggles not only help it see far but also tell you when it sees something moving!\n\n5. **Build Quality:** The internals (all the parts inside the camera that we don't see) are made from better materials and designed more carefully than the cheaper ones. It's like if your dog had an extra layer of fur that keeps him warm even in the snowstorms!\n\nAll these 'superpowers' make expensive cameras perform better than cheaper ones. That's why they might cost more than a few thousand dollars - they have lots more tricks to help take"}

Please explain like I'm five.", "input": "", "output": "Okay, imagine we're talking about building blocks. Each block has a different number, and we are going to play with them.\n\nFirst, let's talk about x^2. When you take 'x' and raise it to the power of 2 (cubing it), it forms a block 'x^2'. When you change this block tiny bit (take its derivative), it becomes '2x'. It's like when you push 'x' one step forward and add it.\n\nNow, let's consider sin^2(x). The 'sin' function and 'cos' function are like other types of building blocks. They're similar but do NOT behave just like 'x' blocks when we tweak them. They don't turn into '2sin x' when you take their derived. This behavior is similar to the differences between building blocks with unique and different properties.\n\nFor the integration part (building something), if you start with 'x', you end up with 'x^2/2'. It's like the thing you build got twice as big as the block you started with. But for 'sin(x)', the construction doesn't follow this pattern, resulting in '\u2212cos(x)', and not 'sin(x)'. This happens because 'sin' and 'cos' blocks follow their own unique patterns.\n\nImagine picture this like: Building with 'x' blocks, you double them ('2x'). But, with 'sin' and 'cos' blocks, they cannot simply be doubled (not '2sin x' or '2cos x'). They have their own unique rules and always follow those, just like the periodic waves you see in a swimming pool.\n\nTo sum it up, 'x' is unique kind of building block, but 'sin' and 'cos' blocks are special too. They follow their own rules while 'x' blocks follow just one rule. Remember, not everything just gets doubled or distributes into simple parts when we play with these blocks. Always follow the respective rules!"}

These people form groups with the same goals and call them 'lobbyists'. They tell their ideas to the group and hope they'll listen.\n\nSometimes, people join these big decision-making groups because they want to. They care about what happens in the country and work hard to make positive changes. This system isn't always perfect. Some joined groups might also give 'let's-play-this-game-together' money (called donations) to these decision-makers.

But, it's not always called 'corruption' unless there is specific rule about not doing it. Corruption would be like breaking the rules in your game. It would be if the decision-makers used their power unfairly because of money, like letting the paid team win by breaking other important decisions.\n\nYou, as a kid, should remember that even though sometimes people talk about linking money with political decisions (like giving 'let's-play-together' money), there are rules that make sure everyone is still playing fair.

That's kind of what dark matter is in the universe \u2014 it's like an invisible toy hiding in plain sight.\n\nSo why do we have dark matter? Scientists think it's there because when they look at the stars in the sky and the way they move, it doesn't match up with what they expect. The stars are like busy bees buzzing around the hive, and mass is like the mass (how much stuff) everything has.\n\nThey need something to explain why everything moves how it does. Dark matter is not something we can see with our eyes or through telescopes right now, because it doesn't give out light like stars or planets do. But it still behaves like a big presence because of its gravity.\n\nGravity is like a pull or a magnet. It's what keeps us on the ground rather than floating away into space. Even if we can't see dark matter, it has gravity, like a big invisible hand that keeps holding everything together. It helps to keep galaxies, which are big groups of stars, from being squished and falling apart because without dark matter, all these stars would fly off into space due to their random movements.\n\nIn short, dark matter plays a vital role in our cosmic universe by making sure everything hangs together like the threads of a big cosmic net.

The ones with a dream to make friends, care for their babies, and all the fun stuff that brings us humans together were better at surviving and having babies too. This is because they could always get support from others when times were tough, like a friend who'd help you out when you needed it. This friendship, care, and togetherness helped them save their peace and keep their families safe.\n\nAs time went on, our parents had tiny baby mammals inside them, which grew inside our mommies and eventually came out as babies.

Explain like I'm five.", "input": "", "output": "Sure, I can help explain how tilt shift photography works! It may look like a toy camera effect, but it's actually a cool technique that photographers use.\n\nImagine you have a super fun toy car. Now, in tilt shift photography, we're pretending that our camera looks like that toy car. We add a little 'lens tilt' and a 'shift' in our camera pictures to make things look 'real small' or 'not real small'.\n\nHere's how the 'real car stuff' works:\n\n1. Using the Tilt: When we tilt our camera, we change the way our camera lens sees things. It's like tilting your head so you can look right at a mischievous caterpillar crawling on the sidewalk not in front of you. So, when we tilt our camera tilt, we're \"looking down\" on the huge scene (like New York City) narrowing down the view. Everything else will look like it's far above us.\n\n2. Then comes the 'Shift': Shift is like picking your toy car\u2019s direction to move sideways instead of up and down. Imagine the caterpillar is still crawling on the sidewalk, but this time you\u2019re trying to take a picture by circling around the tree next to it because it\u2019s blocking your view. This way, you can include both the caterpillar and the tree in the same photo. In photography, it means you can include subjects (like buildings) in the foreground and distant things (like skyscrapers) in the background, otherwise it's difficult because they're usually far apart.\n\nNow, combining tilt and shift, you can take amazing pictures where both things you care about can fit in the same photo without anything being cut off.\n\nThat's tilt shift photography in a nutshell. It makes photos look like toys or magic, but it's just clever use of our camera's lenses to give images a special look."}

Maybe that's why these countries are not fighting him (or now her, since the country is led by a woman named President Bashar al-Assad). Here are a few reasons why:\n\n1. Meddling in other countries' business: This is like if your friend didn't want your friends playing in their yard, they might get upset. The countries don't want to cause more disagreements.\n\n2. Not enough forces: It's like if you had one or two friends when there's a whole big playground full of kids. You think you can handle the situation with just that small number.

This is the SQL Injection at work, someone would trick the magical door into opening up and giving them access to your toys.\n\nNow, how do they learn if their toy box is open?

Here's why:\n\n- Just because someone is really sick, it doesn't mean they may not still feel some hope, experience happiness, or have things to look forward to. We value these feelings and want everyone to have the chance to experience them, no matter what.\n- We want to make it extra sure that anyone thinking of ending their life might actually benefit from more time, care, and help.

Here's a simple way to understand the forces that make the playground, or the stock market, go up or down:\n\n1. **Supply and Demand:** Just like with toys, when more kids want a sticker (demand is high), the price goes up, because a special kid with lots of stickers becomes popular. If fewer kids want stickers (demand is low), then the price falls because the sticker-seller (company) isn't getting as much \"playtime\" (money).\n\n2. **Good Job Performance:** When a company earns more money or discovers something new that they\u2019re very excited about (like a newly invented, most-loved toy), they tell the kids they want to trade more stickers. This can drive up the price because more kids want to buy.\n\n3. **Price Changes:** Sometimes a kid might trade a sticker for a new one because they think they can get a better deal with another kid in the future. This can make the stock price change, as stickers (stocks) get passed around.\n\n4. **Events:** Big announcements or news, like a special event at a friend's house, can change what a kid thinks about trading stickers. A company starting to make a really cool new game is a positive event and can make the sticker's price rise.\n\n5. **Global reasons:** Sometimes, what happens in huge playgrounds (like where kids from other countries come to play) will affect our playground. For example, if kids from other countries bring in more fun new games and toys, it can affect how excited the kids here get about trading. \n\nRemember, just like a playground, the stock market can also be affected by some risks or unexpected events. But generally, it depends on how much people like buying (demand) vs. selling (supply), how companies are doing and finding new ways to make money, and the news and events outside."}

So, IQ tests are kinda like those tricky puzzles and questions we do in school to see how smart we are, but they try to measure our overall brainpower. Scientists and experts say they're pretty good at predicting someone's ability to learn new stuff quickly and understand complex ideas \u2014 like a hint of how well someone might do in school.\n\nBut, just like how every fingerprint is different, not every person is the same. Some might find school more interesting, some might simply be better at sports or music, and that doesn't mean they're dumb. And guess what? People have figured out that how much money someone makes or whether they can be mean to others doesn't rely much on just an IQ score. Being nice, earning a lot of money, or even ending up in trouble usually depends on a lot of different things like their family, school, friends, and choices they make in life.\n\nThink about an IQ test as a starting point, not a ticket to success or the end of the race. Everyone has their own unique strengths, and using these tests shouldn't limit what anyone can achieve. Keep in mind that intelligence can come in many different colors!"}
{"instruction": "What is homeopathy ? Please be civil , I see that reddit feels pretty strongly about it , but please answer without being too opinionated ^_^ Please explain like I'm five.", "input": "", "output": "Homeopathy is a type of medical treatment that some people believe can help heal the body. It's based on an idea called \"like cures like.\" This idea says that if a little bit of something can make a sick person feel better, then a tiny tiny amount of the same thing might be able to make them better if they get sick again from the same cause.\n\nJust like in a game where you switch a teammate's number with the number of the team you're playing against (but you're playing the number backwards), homeopathy does a similar thing. Instead of using real medicine that doctors can measure and see under a microscope, homeopathic doctors use special mixtures that they put under the skin - we call them \"remedies.\" These remedies can be made from lots of things like plants, minerals, or even animals, but they are usually diluted a lot so they don't cause any harm.\n\nPeople who choose homeopathy believe it can treat many types of health issues without using strong medicines that might have side effects. It's used by some people around the world, but many medical professionals prefer to use more traditional methods like vaccines, antibiotics, and surgeries because we know these treatments have strong scientific evidence to say they help a lot of people.\n\nRemember, it's always important to talk to a doctor or a trusted adult before you take any medicine, homeopathic or otherwise. Health is a big deal and every person is different, so what works well for one person might not work the same way for everyone else!"}

After a while, the game is broken and everyone feels unhappy. But what if the kids could find another game that makes everyone happier for a longer time? Amidst the serious situation happening between Ukraine and Russia, many countries and companies also try to find \"games\" that could help them grow stronger or more successful, even though it's causing problems. \n\nSadly, sometimes this \"game\" does more harm than good, hurting soldiers, causing hardship for innocent people caught in the middle, and straining friendships between countries (like those in NATO). But it can also help some businesses, like those selling certain products (called \"Weapons, Fuel, and Other Trade\"), see more people and make more money. \n\nNow, remember, it's always important to try to find peaceful solutions rather than conflicts, like the kids on the playground. The goal should be to ensure everyone, including countries and businesses, get along and are happy."}

When you push it forward, it wants to go back to where you put it, right? That's because it prefers to stay where it's comfortable!\n\n\nNow, think of space like a really big playground, with galaxies (big family groups of stars) roaming around it. Sometimes, like your police car, they want to keep moving. But instead of crashing into things, they move through space. \n\n\nLet's pretend you're zooming along with them in a super-fast spaceship. If the galaxy is zooming away from you, it's like it's stretching. The light (tiny, fast little rays) from that galaxy gets a bit longer, like when you pull a jump rope and stretch it out. The longer light stretches, the more it shifts towards the red part of the rainbow. This is what we call redshift!\n\n\nRedshift helps us know if galaxies are getting closer to us or running away. It's a big clue in the story of our universe and helps us see how it's growing bigger and bigger over time!"}

It's like a big birthday party for an important idea called \"unity.\" Now, unity means bringing people together and helping everyone feel like they're a part of one big family, no matter where they're from or what they believe.\n\nKwanzaa was created in 1966 by a man named Dr. Maulana Karenga. It came to be during a time when African Americans wanted to celebrate their culture and history, just like people from different places around the world celebrate their own special ways. Dr. Karenga thought of a way to honor African culture and bring black people together, following the same spirit as other holidays like Christmas and Hanukkah.\n\nA lot of African Americans, people of African heritage around the world, like to celebrate Kwanzaa. They gather with family and friends to have fun and to remember their roots. Instead of presents, they focus on sharing gifts that remind them of important ideas. These ideas have seven parts called \"Nguzo Saba\" (I can spell that! N-G-Z-O-Z-A-B-A). Here are what each one means:\n \n1. Umoja (Unity): Having a strong family bond.\n2. Kujichagulia (Self-determination): Making their own choices.\n3. Ujima (Collective work and responsibility): Helping others and the community.\n4. Ujamaa (Cooperative economics): Working together to make money and help the community.\n5. Nia (Purpose): Knowing what they want to achieve.\n6. Kuumba (Creativity): Being innovative and making their community better.\n7. Imani (Faith): Believing in their dreams and in each other.\n\nTo celebrate Kwanzaa, people decorate their homes with vibrant and colorful things called mkeka, which means cloth. They also use candles, like a birthday cake has, and colorful ornaments called kinara. They talk about the seven principles and reflect on how they've grown at the end of the festival. People also play warm and fun games and make yummy food together to share with each other. "}

Everybody loves playing with new toys, but what if you didn't know how to play with it?\n\nSo, people are like super smart engineers, creators of computers. They knew they had to make computers understand how to start and perform basic tasks. So, just like that first time playing with your toy, they removed all the bits and pieces that made the computer work and replaced them a little at a time with things they made called \"birth\" before its general instructions, also known as an operating system (OS).\n\nThe first big birth, called an operating system, was actually called \"Baby\" or \"Mother\" or \"Diana\". It just helped the computer understand how to start up and perform basic stuff like reading or writing, similar to learning to count or alphabet.\n\nFrom there, our super smart engineers kept learning from the computer how it was playing. They would add more and more special instructions called \"software\" to help the computer become even more amazing! Now, the computer can help us write letters, watch videos, or even play games!\n\nAnd that's how the first computer learned a lot of fun things thanks to the smart engineers that helped design it."}

It makes things simpler than counting all the toys every time!\n\nThis game plan, or the Electoral College, was created a long time ago by smart people who didn't want a big group like the \"parliament\" (like in a big sandbox where all the little kids meet). They wanted to spread out the power, so each state or 'room' could have a voice and to keep things interesting, like how everybody gets a turn to match blocks.\n\nEven though some people - like kids who want everything sorted out - want to change this method, they haven't, because it was set up a long, long time ago. Also, it would be like switching major game rules instantly, which could make everything confusing. So, the Electoral College, like all rules and systems, is there to work like a big fun game where everyone finds out who enjoys the toy the most after all!"}

This test checks if you've been using drugs, sort of like a detective sniffing out snacks in your pockets.\n\nSome people believe that this test is not fair, like it's a big straw to blow on a cupcake and force someone to do something they didn't do. They feel like it's not nice, since everyone goes through a pinch when they've got an ouchie, but it's only supposed to happen when it's necessary. They also worry that this test goes along with other rules that might make it harder for some friends to get the help they need, like trying to buy a chocolate bar at a special price inside a far-away place.\n\nThese folks say it\u2019s not right to ask someone to take this test before they can get help, because people deserve kindness and a chance to be better, just like you want someone to help you clean up your spilled juice box at the party.

The leader of this group, named Nixon, also tried to secretly record the people in the room talking to hide their mistakes.\n\nWhen the FBI, which is like a superhero team that helps people follow rules, became involved and found out about these secret recordings, Nixon got very worried. He decided to keep looking through all the recordings to find the mistakes he and his team made, hoping he could fix everything.\n\nHowever, as more and more secrets were discovered, people began to feel that Nixon was trying to cover up the wrong things. That means he was not being honest and was messing things up even more, instead of fixing them. \n\nThen, people in a very important government group called the House of Representatives, which makes sure that all the rules are being followed correctly, decided that Nixon needed to go to a court. The court is another place where they make sure everyone is following the rules. \n\nWhen Nixon tried to say \"no, just let me go be the President,\" the court superhero, called the Supreme Court, said, \"No, you have to go!\" So Nixon had nowhere else to go but, sadly, he had to step down from being the President on August 9, 1974, which was a big shock to everyone, including the whole United States."}

Callie was like a big fishing spot, ever-present and limited in how far apart her spots (cell towers) could be. Whenever your device wanted to talk to someone in Smartville, it would hop onto Callie, who could always find you. But Callie could only help you on a local level, like providing maps for nearby places.\n\nWhile Callie was great for talking and telling you it's raining outside, there was another friend, WiFi. WiFi was like a big, enchanted (though invisible) honeycomb that filled Smartville. Your device was like a tiny ant who could recognize the unique taste of each honeycomb. When you touched this honeycomb, it let your device know it's right there in General Store, Star Caf\u00e9, or even in Big Peach Tree. \n\nIf your device doesn't have to travel far, they both can play this beautiful game of 'Give and Take' (message exchange).

When your device is on WiFi, it checks out all the nearby honeycombs (wifi networks). Major cities have many of these enchanting honeycombs. Seeing so many at once helps your device understand that it's not far from downtown, where most are found.\n\nIn this playful game of give and take, your device chooses the best honeycomb (wifi network) for location services based on immediate location accuracy, rather than communication range. It's like a really efficient map-making person who always brings the best map possible. That's how WiFi makes your apps like swarm or maps even better at exactly saying where your device is!"}

Those are called 3D, short for three-dimensional.\n\nNow, imagine if we had another \u201cdirection\u201d that we could move in along with the other three. This idea is what we call the 4th dimension. It's like adding another layer of space, but it doesn't mean seeing things come from the tops. In the 4th dimension, time can be the extra direction we're talking about! \n\nNow, about 4th dimensional shapes: they're a little hard to imagine because our world is only 3D. But let's think of a square. A square is a 2D shape, it only has length and breadth. Now, if we stretched that square in such a way that except for those two dimensions (length and breadth), it also gains a third dimension, it will still look like a square, just bigger or smaller. The inside of that \"stretched square\" would be a 3D cube.\n\nNow, stretch the 3D cube into a 4th dimension, the one we added (which can be compared to time), we end up with a shape called a tesseract or a 4D cube. In a 4D cube, we have all the characteristics of a 3D cube but with an added \"direction\". Each corner of the 4D cube isn't in the 3D space we live in, but it meets with four 3D cubes. So if you try to track it, it might be like a line that changes depending on the direction you're walking. Just remember, we can't really see it because our brains work in a 3D space. But scientists and mathematicians can work out what it might look like! Isn't that fascinating?"}

These cities are big since they produce a lot of oil, which is like the fuel that powers the cars and trains we use.\n\nNow, some people think this \"Keystone Pipeline\" is a very good idea because it helps move the oil from the big cities to where more people need it, which can help make the cost of things in our houses lower, like gas for cars.\n\nBut, it's a bit controversial, which is a fancy word for causing arguments and disagreements. Here are a few reasons why folks might be upset about it:\n\n1. **Safety Concerns**: Just like we have to be careful with our toys to avoid accidents, people worry about accidents happening with the pipeline, which could harm the environment - like spilling oil into the ground, rivers, or forests.\n\n2. **Climate Change**: Do you know how a blizzard in your adventure park might impact the animals living there? Well, oil, when burned to make fuel, contributes to 'climate change,' a sort of dirty blanket that makes Earth hotter and can change weather patterns. That can harm animals, plants, and even our own homes!\n\n3. **Land Rights and Impacts**: Building a big real-life toy line would likely require new paths, which could disrupt or hurt the places and homes for people and animals already living there, like squirrels, birds, or nearby human communities.\n\nBut don't worry, folks aren't just thinking about this one \"Keystone Pipeline.\" The U.S. has many other train lines for moving the things we need, like oil, just using different routes and paths for them."}

But, if the toys are all mixed up inside, finding a specific toy would be a bit challenging.\n\nEntropy is a tricky word, but in simple terms, it's a measure of how much \"mess\" or \"disorder\" there is in a collection of things. In the case of your box of toys, if everything is neatly organized, the entropy (or mess) is low, and if it's all jumbled up, the entropy (or mess) is high.\n\nIn the world of science, especially when talking about heat, energy, and matter, entropy helps us understand how systems (like your toy box) can change from one situation to another. You can think of it like the natural tendency of a system to become more disordered over time, just as the mess in your toy box eventually tends to make things less organized without cleaning up.\n\nMathematically, scientists use a special number - entropy - to represent this messiness in different situations. When they talk about energy or stuff like heat, moving around, and even when they study stars, entropy helps them understand and predict how things will behave."}

Oh no, whoops!\n\nDoing exactly what you're supposed to is hard sometimes because everyone makes mistakes - it's in our human way. When we learn something, it's like going uphill on a bike, sometimes you slip and make mistakes. Bugs are there to show us where we slipped, to help us improve for the next time. In building any thing or coding a program, the more we learn and understand, the fewer mistakes we'll make.

Now, instead of running through every game, you decide to focus on a few that are your favorites. \n\nCommon Core Math is a bit like that. In the United States, we all follow certain rules (called standards) to understand math better. Think of these standards as the cheat sheets for the games. \n\nCommon Core Math is focused on five main areas, or \"strands\":\n\n1. Number and Operations - This is about learning the basic math facts like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It's like learning how to play the treasure hunt game, where you add clues to move forward.\n\n2. Algebraic Thinking - This part is about understanding patterns. It's like creating your art on the walls of the party, but the patterns are numbers (for example, the sequence 2, 4, 6, 8).\n\n3. Geometry - This is the part where we work with shapes. If you were at the party, this would be like arranging furniture. We're exploring shapes, properties, and the relationship between them.\n\n4. Measurement - This involves understanding and comparing measurements of time, length, and area. It's like keeping track of how long you dance, how far you move from the snack table to the party wall, or the size of the treasure you're hunting for.\n\n5. Data Analysis and Probability - This part teaches you to understand and use data. If you were at a party, it's knowing how many balloons everyone has, guessing who might win the dance-off, or figuring out who will run out of snacks first.\n\nComparing these standards with the old ones is kind of like going from a small children's party to a bigger, more organized festival. It allows everyone to better understand what they're doing (solving a math problem), why they're doing it (the meaning of the problem), and discussing and learning from others (sharing and learning new strategies). \n\nAnd most importantly, this approach to learning math was designed so that you understand the concepts, rather than just solving the problems. It's like learning how to play the game of treasury-hunting,"}

Inside this playground, there are tiny workers (chemicals) that help us think, feel, and do things, like how you play with your friends or eat your favorite snack.\n\nWhen you see a friend smiling at you, it makes you feel happy, right? That's because some workers in the playground work together and release happy chemicals, like dancing confetti that makes you feel good. In simple words, these chemicals make the 'self-esteem' slide in your brain a happy one, and this joy makes you feel good about yourself.\n\nNow, sometimes some friends may tease you or put you in a situation that's not very nice. When that happens, the workers may release a little bit of a different kind of confetti, but this one sometimes makes you feel sad or not-so-good about yourself. This is like when you try to slide down the wrong one and feel a bit scared, that's the time your self-esteem slide isn\u2019t as happy.\n\nBut remember, your brain can work wonders. It's like playing imaginatively on the playground with your friends. When times are tough or your self-esteem balls are drooping a bit, you can talk to your parents, teachers, or friends and play around until the happy dance confetti starts flowing again! So, it's not all predetermined by chemistry, and we can definitely make a change by playing and managing our feelings."}

Now, every city (or species) has its rules for parties, right? People might throw pizza parties, while cats might throw a nocturnal mouse party.\n\nIn the world of animals, every \"city\" or species often has different rules for their parties. These rules are like special instructions that tell egg and sperm how to know if they're supposed to have a party together or not.\n\nThe instructions inside the egg and sperm are these little things called \"genes.\" You can think of genes as recipes for making a creature, just like mom's recipes for cookies!\n\nNow, as we all know, a human's genes are a bit different from a horse's genes. It's kind of like putting Cookie Recipe A (for humans) with Cookie Recipe B (for horses) \u2013 it wouldn't make sense, would it? No recipe tells you to bake a human cookie using horse ingredients. It would confuse everyone and leave you with strange cookies nobody liked!\n\nSame goes for our friends (egg and sperm). When a human and horse egg and sperm party, the genes do not match up. They just can't understand each other's instructions. This mismatch prevents them from having a baby together. It's like trying to put together a piece of human jigsaw with a piece from a horse puzzle.

If a few other birds hear that song and like it a lot, they might copy it. They do this to show they are part of the group. They want to be friends and welcome to the team too.\n\nBut it's not just about becoming popular. Sometimes, copying others' behaviors can be helpful for survival.

For computers, they use red and blue blocks (or we call them 1s and 0s) instead of red or blue blocks.\n\nWhen they write things using 1s and 0s, it's like they're putting a red block for every \"yes\" or a blue block for every \"no.\" Each 1 or 0 is an instruction for the computer, telling it what to do. We start with a small group of blocks, like 0-0-0-1 or 1-1-0-0. These small groups are called binary digits, or \"bits\" for short.\n\nThen we can make bigger and bigger groups of these bits to mean more and more things. Imagine putting four red blocks (1-1-1-1) to mean \"go to the next screen\" and just one blue block (0) to mean \"stop talking.\" A really big group could be 10101011, and it helps us write secret codes or use computers to do many things.\n\nIn summary: \n- Red block stands for \"yes\" or 1\n- Blue block stands for \"no\" or 0\n- Big groups are like instructions for the computer to do specific things\n\nIt's like we're turning secret messages into a special code using red, blue, and their combinations!"}

This field is long and has two big goals at opposite ends, just like a hockey rink. But instead of using sticks and a puck, the people on the field move around and try to run with an egg-shaped ball to get it into the other goal.\n\n1. There are two teams, called the offense and the defense. Each team has players with special roles \u2013 some run fast and pass the ball, while others try to catch or block it. Half the team sits on one side (offense) and the other half on the other side (defense).\n\n2. The game starts with a snap (like a hand signal) when the player with the ball passes it to one of their teammates. This player with the ball is called the quarterback (QB). Their job is to lead the team and find the best spot possible to throw or run with the ball towards the other team's goal.\n\n3. The field has open spaces called yards. Whenever a team gets the ball over to the other team's side, you add up those yards. The goal is to have more yards than the other team, and the goalpost is at the back of their endzone. If a runner gets all the way across (past the goal line) and into the endzone while holding the ball, the team scores a touchdown. That's worth six points!\n\n4. Right after scoring a touchdown, the team can either try to get one more point by running or passing the ball into the goalpost called the extra point or two more points by passing the ball through the goalposts without getting tackled, which is called a 2-point conversion.\n\n5. The offense has four chances (downs) in a set amount of time (four quarters) to try to score. If they don't, the other team takes over and tries to stop them from scoring.\n\n6. During the play, the defensive team tries to stop the offense's player from getting the ball into the endzone while at the same time catch or tackle their players.

When these monsters come near your castle, they're not very nice to the things inside. They make damage to the food, water, and air \u2013 I mean, they damage the cells in our body.\n\nThese cells are very important because they're like tiny little workers in your body. They work together, doing all sorts of jobs that keep your body working properly. But if these monsters (radiation) damage the cells, those workers can't do their jobs anymore.\n\nFor example, red blood cells take oxygen from the air we breathe to our muscles and other parts of our body. If radiation damages them, our muscles can't get the oxygen they need, and we may not be able to do things like run or jump as easily as we normally would.\n\nWhen a lot of monsters come towards your castle and damage a lot of cells, it's like the whole castle, in a way, gets sick.

Everyone puts some money into this photo album (the hedge fund), but they don't do it for free like when they buy candy at the store. They usually pay for a chance to be in the team, known as a \"management fee\", which is like a small part of their contribution put aside for their efforts.\n\n3. The team also earns an \"incentive fee\", which is a bigger part of their contribution that they get from making more money, just like when they win a prize.\n\nWhy is a hedge fund worth a lot?\n\nA hedge fund becomes worth a lot because the people in the team (investors) are smart and make really good decisions most of the time, just like picking the winning team in a school relay race.

Like when you're playing a game with your new friend who speaks a different language, and you don't want anyone to get confused, you might have to change your accent for a little bit.\n\nSpeaking without accents is like pretending to be someone else for just a moment. When you talk to your grandma, it's more fun when you talk with your own accent, isn't it? Just like everyone's hair and clothes are different, languages and accents are unique too. But when communication is difficult, sometimes changing the accent helps people understand each other better."}
{"instruction": "What is the difference between Protestant , Othordox , and Catholic ? What makes these religions different ? Also : Do they use different bibles ? How would you tell them apart ? Please explain like I'm five.", "input": "", "output": "Alright, imagine we have three big families who talk and act differently. These families are like the Protestant, Orthodox (which sounds like Othorodox but actually it's Orthodox in spelling), and Catholic families, which are really big groups of people with special ways of doing things because of their religion.\n\nNow, the Protestant family talks and does things in a way that they focus more on reading the Bible and believing in their own personal understanding of it. So, they don't have all their rules in a book like the Catholic family does; they use something called the Holy Bible but might use different versions called the Authorized Version or the English Standard Version.\n\nThe Orthodox family loves to sing special songs and follow a lot of old traditions that remind them of their long history. When they read the Bible, they use the Bible, too, but they speak their own language (like Russian, Greek or others).\n\nThe Catholic family has its own big book called the Bible and something called the Catechism of the Catholic Church that has lots of rules called 'canon'. This helps them to know what to do and why.\n\nTo tell these families apart, you can think about a few things:\n\n1. Dressing: Some Protestants wear all sorts of clever clothes, some Orthodox people wear silver crosses on their collars, while Catholics wear specially blessed clothes, including crosses and rings. The clothes tell you who they belong to. Just like how pajamas say you belong to the house of sleepers!\n\n2. Food: Just like different families have their own preferred food to cook, these religious families might eat different foods on special days. For example, during a special day called Easter, Catholics might eat a special fish meal, while Orthodox people might eat something different in their own unique way.\n\n3. Celebrations: All families have special days they celebrate together, but each family has its own way of showing joy. Catholics might have a Western Church service on Christmas with a big church full of trumpets and bells, Orthodox might have a service that begins at midnight and goes on until the sun comes up with lots of beautiful lights. Protestants might have a service talking about special stories and singing hymns.\n\nRemember, even though they are different, they all share their"}

It can be like:\n\n1. Heart racing so fast you think you might faint.\n2. Breathing too fast, feeling like you can't get enough air.\n3. Feeling like you're losing control or going crazy.\n4. Hands shaking or sweating a lot.\n5. Sometimes, seeing or hearing things that aren't there or feeling disconnected from your body.\n\nNow, let's say you come back home and see your housemate having one. They might feel some of these feelings and start acting differently. Here's what can help:\n\n1. Stay calm and tell them they're safe, and you're there for them.\n2. Give them some space if they want it, but let them know they can talk to you.\n3. Help them focus on deep breathing. Take slow breaths in through the nose and out through the mouth. It may help them feel a bit better.\n4. Offer to get them water or a glass of milk, as it can sometimes trigger their panic feeling when the mouth gets dry.\n5. Encourage them to sit down and relax, but don't force them.\n6. If it's okay with them, you can try a grounding exercise. For example, ask them to name things they see in the room, smell or touch (like a gentle blanket or the fabric of their pants).\n7. Time matters \u2013 90% of the attacks last shorter than 10 minutes, so they'll usually be better shortly. Just keep helping them until they're calmer or cooperative with medical help.\n\nIt's great that you remembered having panic attacks when you were younger, but there\u2019s no need to worry if you're feeling scared or not well-remembered.

It's kind of like having tiny doctors that work really hard to heal your body.\n\nSometimes, the skin gets very hurt, and the pictures are not the same once they're fixed. So, the markings are different than before, and they stay there forever, creating a scar. These marks are a sign of your body's special \"cleaning\" process and help to keep you safe from germs and bacteria that might enter through those cuts or wounds.\n\nWhile scars are a gift from your body's amazing healing power, they can't be completely removed because your body needs a way to remember these events to tell you not to touch or hurt that area again.

Edit : To clarify , why is piracy considered okay by the internet community at large ?

This issue can be a complicated topic, but let's break it down using a simple story:\n\nImagine that you made a really cool Lego set with lots of special parts, scenery, and instructions. Your Lego set would be considered the artist's work in our real world. You put a lot of time, effort, and thought into creating this unique set, and you want people to appreciate it because you worked hard on it. So, you set a price for your Lego set to stand up for your effort and to help you continue making more creative stuff. This is like what artists on the internet or \"in real world\" do. They create something, they put effort into it, and often it takes money to come up with the work.\n\nNow, imagine that someone takes your fancy Lego set without paying for it, maybe even puts it in a different context or uses it in a completely different way in their own build. This is like piracy on the Internet. Instead of losing traditional stuff, like a box full of Legos, digital pirates can copy and distribute content, like music, movies, or pictures, online. This could harm the artists because the pirated versions can undermine their work and earnings.\n\nOh yes! But you're also still legally allowed to build with your Lego set in any way you want, just like artists want to explore their creeps and convey themart ideas with their work. They desire the freedom to express themselves entirely, but also need to make money because that can help them create new works.\n\nNow, most people on the Internet and in real-word don't respect the value of artists' work much like respecting how someone likes to build with their Lego set. They're usually comfortable with enjoying something (like music, movies, or copyrighted images) without wanting to pay for it. While many people do enjoy kinds of artists' works, respecting the artists and valuing what paid for is part of supporting a healthy environment for creativity online, in real-world, and for everyone."}

Instead, it's moved to a special place called the \"Recycle Bin\" for computers or \"Trash\" for phones and tablets. It's like putting the toys in a bag to keep them out of your neat space for some time.\n\nNow, your mommy or daddy (also known in this case as the OS - Operating System) might want to use that space for new games (files). They'll eventually empty this bag (deleting the files in the Recycle Bin or the Trash). This is how the deleted files are removed from your device.

One is using sunshine, called solar power, and the other way is using tiny power containers, which we call nuclear energy.\n\nUsing sunshine works well on places where we can stay in the sun a lot, like space stations. But when we need to go really far into space and beyond, we really need a lot of power and we don't have time to wait for sunlight, right? That's when people thought, \"Hey, maybe we could put that tiny nuclear energy power containers inside the rocket.\"\n\nThis seems good because nuclear power is powerful and can last a long time. But, there are some rules we have to follow. We do not want to bring any tiny power boxes into space that could harm the people or the environment. This is really important, so astronauts can safely explore space and don't hurt the beautiful stars and planets.\n\nBecause of these rules, most rockets like your big space shuttles imagine to carry on journeys far away stay powered by the sun, even though it only works when they're close to stars like our sun.

You know how sometimes you choose a spot in your room where you keep your toys best? Maybe you love to have all your toys and others' toys in the same room part because you find it makes playing together faster. We do that with capitals too!\n\nUsually, the capital isn't picked through a big, fun game or election. Instead, it's more like the decisions are made by grown-ups who make laws and talk about things that affect everyone living in that area. \n\nAs for whether a capital city can change, yes, sometimes it can, like game pieces swapping places in Lineup Lotto. But it's not very common. It needs to be a big decision, as the new city needs to be an important spot where all the main things happening happen. Just remember, every kid loves a good adventure, but growing into a teenager might not be as fun. Changing a capital is a grown-up thing to do, just like opening a new chapter in the storybook of your country's history."}
{"instruction": "Why 2 liters of 100 % pure orange juice cost ~4 $ while it takes way more than 4 $ worth of real oranges to get the same amount of juice ? Even by using Professional juice extractor at home . Where 's the catch ? Please explain like I'm five.", "input": "", "output": "Alright, let's imagine you want to make orange juice. You have two options: You can buy bottled \"pure orange juice\" (like Coca Cola) and you can use real oranges (fresh ones) and make the juice yourself at home.\n\nBuying 2 liters of 100% pure orange juice is cheaper (about $4) because it is made from concentrate, which is made by squeezing out all the liquid from oranges and removing most of the water. That process makes the juice concentrate much smaller, stronger in flavor, and it contains a lot of sugar (called \"high-fructose corn syrup\" in some cases) to make it taste good and last longer. After you buy the concentrate, all you need to do is add water to it, and voila, you get 2 liters of 100% pure orange juice!\n\nOn the other hand, real orange juice has more water, fewer sugars, and the taste might not be as strong as the one you buy in a bottle. To make 2 liters of it, you have to use a bunch of fresh oranges (let's say 40 oranges!). You then squeeze them, pour the juice into a bowl to separate it from the pulp, and filter it with a cloth. But even though you're already doing a lot of work (gathering oranges, squeezing, filtering), you still need to take more time and be very careful not spoil or waste any juice in the process.\n\nSo, there is a catch! Bottled 100% pure orange juice has spent some of its value in processing and packaging, but you get a fantastic amount of juice and much less hassle. Making it yourself with fresh oranges takes more time, effort, and you might end up using more oranges (and wasting part of them) to get to the same 2 liters of juice. Both ways have their own pros and cons, but if you're in a hurry, buying pre-packaged juice is often the better choice for a consistent and convenient refreshment."}

Just like couches use air from the surrounding room to cool things down, the special ceilings in grocery stores have a system called natural ventilation. \n\nThis system pulls in cool air from above and lets hot air escape, which helps to keep the store cool without needing a lot of electricity. So even if it costs more money to build these tall store ceilings, the store owners will save a lot of money on the price of electricity later!\n\nThe higher the ceilings, the more air can move in and out, so the store stays fresh and cool.

This force is made by burning fuel very quickly and creating a big, powerful explosion. The place where this fire starts inside the engine isn't a round shape like you see in some other engines. Instead, it has a pointy end that helps the fire spread all around inside.\n\nImagine you have two balloons. One is round, and it blows out balloon air everywhere equally. The second one is kind of like a party hat and, when you blow air into it, it only blows air out the hole at the pointy end. The space shuttle engine is like the party hat balloon because the fire needs to spread out evenly, which is easier with the pointy end.\n\nThe cone shape also helps keep the inside of the engine safe. Everything that's hot from the fire has to go down the sides of the cone to reach the parts of the engine that aren't burning.

However, sometimes, these steps may not happen instantly or turn into a full-fledged legal case (like when a big kid takes away another kid and they go to the teacher). \n\nBut remember, when someone does something wrong, it's not just about what's allowed during a game. After the game, if the player continues being mean, their team might have to release them from the team. Sometimes, they might even need to apologize, or maybe they learn a lesson and become better players and teammates, just like the fashion-less son who wins back Mom's love with apologies. You see, everyone makes mistakes. The important part is to learn from them."}

I just finished watching God Loves Uganda on Netflix . Please explain like I'm five.", "input": "", "output": "Alright, let me explain it simply for you!\n\nWhen you see people speaking in tongues that they can't understand (and sometimes they shake), they are usually involved in a religious practice known as speaking in tongues. This happens in some Christian Christian groups like evangelical Christianity.\n\nHere's how it happens, think of it like this:\n\n1. People believe that God may come to them in a special way, in a language they can't understand. This language is called \"tongues.\"\n\n2. They usually feel good feelings like joy and excitement. They think this language is given by God to help them feel closer to Him.\n\n3. They practice and speak in this language in their religious group. It's like learning a new secret language that's only known by their friends in the group.\n\n4. When they speak in tongues, they might shake a little bit because it can feel like a natural reaction to the happy emotions they feel.\n\nIt's important to remember that this explanation doesn't compel everyone in the group to believe in this way of speaking, some choose to believe in different ways. Also, some people may wonder about people who speak in tongues and feel it's not the same for everyone.\n\nI hope this helps you understand a little bit more about the practice of speaking in tongues among some evangelical Christians! If you have more questions, feel free to ask."}

You're making one big paper puzzle and coloring it with markers. But now you want to make it so that people can play this puzzle game on their cool gaming computer, or their fancy Xbox, or their PlayStation - those are all like different types of boxes or rooms that you can play in.\n\nTo make it work in each room, you have to think carefully about what makes each room different. So, you might draw a special picture for each room to make it feel extra fun for the people who are using it. This is like drawing different maps or adding special stuff to the room to make it special.\n\nBut mostly, your big puzzle game is made with the same colors and pieces, and you just need to add a little something different for each room, kind of like sticking a different cover on each book in a series. This way, you can still share the fun of your puzzle game in every room, but give each room a bit of its own special feel."}

When we say a file is \"corrupt,\" it means something in the box went wrong. There may be a picture that got a big smudge or a character that looks different or missing when you try to open it. The box isn't broken; it just has a little problem inside.\n\nThis problem could happen for different reasons. Sometimes, the game might be stored incorrectly in the box, or it might not have gotten enough sleep (charged batteries). Imagine if a nightlight (power) didn't turn on, but your parents still thought you'd be able to open your box to play games.\n\nSo, when a file on a PS2 memory card becomes corrupt, it's not \"rocket science.\" It's like your favorite toy broke, but we can fix it by making it charge longer and letting it get cozy and fresh (closing the PS2 and letting it restart the games safely). If a file on the memory card is broken or corrupt, we might still be able to fix it with special tools or by playing less, letting it heal better."}

Let\u2019s break it down!\n\nThink of a plant like it strikes a match (because fire starts this!) and sparks off a big fire. \n\n1. Startup: First, we heat up water in a huge tank with fuel rods inside it. These rods have special info called uranium. Just like how crayons melt in warm hands, the uranium inside these rods heat up slowly when they catch fire from the uranium inside.\n\n2. Power Generation: Just like a steamship that goes forward with its steam, the heated water from the rods turns into water steam, which powers a turbine connected to a big fan (like a tail in the tailfin of an airplane). This fan, called a generator, creates electricity. But it's actually power for many homes and businesses, not just one.\n\n3. Stability: The special info inside the uranium clues also know when to help keep things in balance. Starting as a little flame, it helps regulate how hot the rods and water tank get. If they get too hot, it slows down. If they get too slow, it increases. It's like a thermostat in your home.\n\n4. Energy Storage: As for storing energy, just as we save toys in the toy chest, the energy does not stay in the reactor. The steam turns the big fan (the generator), which creates electricity. At the same time, we store the cooled water to go back to our steam factory (the water tank). By the time it goes back, it\u2019s cool enough to become steam again.\n\nBut remember, the Energy lighting your world is used right away. It's not stored for later like we might store our toys, but used as we need it.\n\nAlso, keep in mind, this plant is managed by very smart people, because it isn\u2019t as playful as your toy planet. Safety is their top priority."}
{"instruction": "Can someone explain why currencies move up and down ? And more specifically why the British Pound and the Euro rarely move these days . Explain like I'm five.", "input": "", "output": "Alright, kiddo! Think of the value of a nation's currency like the prices of toys at a toy store. \n\n1. Demand: When people want more and more toys (which means the demand increases), the store raises the price of every toy. It's the same with currencies. If a country's goods are popular worldwide, the global demand for its currency increases, it makes the currency value rise.\n\n2. Supply: Sometimes toys become less popular (or maybe too popular). When there's too many of them, the store decreases the price. It's the opposite with currencies. If a country's economy is not doing well, its currency's value drops (or the supply increases) so fewer people will want it.\n\n3. Government Policies: Again, come back to the toy store. The owner can decide to raise, lower, or keep the toy prices steady. A country's government does something similar known as monetary policies. It can influence the currency's value by increasing or decreasing the interest rates, for example.\n\nNow, your questions are about the British Pound (GBP) and Euro (EUR), specifically GBP and EUR not moving much lately. It's like in the toy store, sometimes there's a steady number of toys brought to store and they keep selling at same price. The value of the GBP and EUR remains stable because the supply and demand for these currencies balance well due to solid economies, political stability, and constant economic growth. \n\nHowever, remember, in the real world as well as the toy store, currency values also fluctuate. It's like sometimes we see more expensive toys and sometimes less. Same with GBP and EUR. But on current days, these two currencies aren't seeing much variation because their economies are healthy and strong."}

A pause helps us tell when you're finished with one letter and start with the next. Just like \"PLAY PAUSE\" in music, there's a pause in Morse code from one letter to the next. If you don't hear that pause, it's just part of the same letter."}

This concept is sometimes called chaos theory. It shows that even the tiniest things can have a big impact when we don\u2019t expect it.\n\nThis idea makes us realize that everything we do, no matter how small, can impact things around us.

But people love different things in different places, just like how some people like vanilla ice cream and others like chocolate. So the Nazis had their ideas about a traditional German monarchy (a king or queen like in fairy tales) but other people, including new leaders at the time, were more interested in having a President (a different way of leading a country) - like how some of you might prefer playing soccer rather than basketball. It was a matter of what people believed and liked, not just about national symbols or traditions alone."}

When you your spoons like in a twisty gesture, it's tougher to spin, but go ahead with three spoons and it's easier to do a big twirl.\n\nThat's why a wind turbine has three blades. When the wind blows, it \"caresses\" the blades and makes them spin. More blades mean there's more surface to catch the wind, and it doesn't get too tired \u2013 or hot \u2013 because it doesn\u2019t spin too fast. That makes it better at making power for us to use.

Imagine this: it was like a big heated wheelbarrow got out of control and it affected a lot of Earth's beach. It got very, very hot and very, very shiny (this means the radiation, which is not good). People couldn't live there anymore because it messed up their sand, the land's healthy living things, and humans and animals. That's why it became uninhabitable, which means 'not safe for people'.\n\nNow, let's think about Hiroshima with its nuclear bomb. Remember that wheelbarrow full of shiny marbles? In Hiroshima's case, it was a different kind of shiny, hot marble. This made the sand (people, their homes, and animals) very hot in a very short time - not like the slow wearing down we talked about before. But, after the wheelbarrow was put back (i.e., after the effects of the bomb, they started becoming less), they were careful to not mix more wheelbarrows (radiation) into the beach (if you see what I mean), so they could start to live again. But, it wasn't the same way as Chernobyl, and life in Hiroshima got really tricky and hard because of those shiny, hot marbles. It's a different kind of hard compared to how Chernobyl's beach turned to desert because of having too many shiny, hot wheelbarrows thrown around on the sand too long."}

It's kind of like a crazy story about a group of teenagers in a future society who have a lot of violent energy. They like to do things that are very harmful and mean to others, but they also find happiness and excitement in their actions.\n\nThe movie is not just about showing the violent behavior of these young people. It's also trying to make us think about different things. One important message is about the idea of choices. It asks the question, \"Is it our choice to decide what kind of actions we do, even if others think those actions are wrong?\" It makes us think about how much power we really have over our choices and if there are consequences when we make them.\n\nAnother aspect of the movie focuses on society and how it can affect people. In the story, the government and people in charge are very strict and try to \"reprogram\" the violent teenagers to prevent them from doing those harmful things. This raises the question of whether it's right for others to control us and change our ways.\n\nThe movie can be complex and not just about blood and scary scenes, but it's essential to explore different ideas and reflect on our behavior and society's rules and judgments. The storyline of \"Clockwork Orange\" challenges the audience to think about the good and bad in ourselves and in the outside world. As if you were only five, think of it like a grown-up conversation that helps the audience have a new view of themselves and how they should be treated."}

Because even if you don't see anyone inside the office at night, someone could still be there, working or at least using other things in the office. \n\nIt's like having your lamp on when you're in your room playing video games. Even though nobody else is in the room, that lamp is still on because there's a light inside your game console's screen that makes it possible for you to play.\n\nDon't forget, these big office buildings have other features besides just the lights. They also have security and maintenance systems, computers, elevators, and maybe delicious coffee machines. They need power just like your toys and games do. Otherwise, those important machines and security systems would stop working expert, which can be a problem during emergencies.\n\nAlthough it might seem like we are not saving much by having the lights on, every bit actually helps. Imagine if we did save some extra money by turning off the lights, maybe we could use that money for even better things in the building, like more places for people to hangout or bigger coffee machines! But remember, even though we're using some energy to keep the lights on and machines working, it's all about finding a happy middle ground where we save energy, keep everything running smoothly, and also keep doing what's best for the people working in those big buildings.

Trying to trick a polygraph isn't right. Experts say it's really hard to cheat because polygraph tests are designed to be pretty reliable in detecting lies. They're like the school monitors who always spot when someone cheats. Equally important is that the results of a polygraph don't officially prove someone told a lie, just like how you wouldn't accuse someone of cheating just because they got a good result on a school test. An experienced polygrapher, who conducts these tests, tries to encourage good behavior rather than force you to tell the truth, making cheating more challenging."}

Embezzling money means someone who is supposed to be managing and looking after the money takes some money for themselves illegally.

Instead of keeping your pocket money safe for good, you decide to take some to buy things you like, like candies or mini-boards.\n\nHere's a simple guideline to how someone might embezzle money at a company or city:\n\n1. Position: They get a job (like being a school monitor) where they handle money. It can be as a department head, a manager or even the head of a city like a Mayor.\n\n2. Make it look right: They carry on with their job as they always did, sort of like pretending they're still putting away money.\n\n3. Freeze moment: Some times they might even decide to just wait and see, maybe once they have earned the trust of the one they're manipulating.\n\n4. Gadgets and gear: They might make fake sales or invoices and get their own company to pay them, so the money seems like it's being spent legitimately.\n\nThey can also make \"friendly\" people, like vendors or suppliers, agree to pay them money. It's like making your friends pay you for lending them your piggy bank.\n\nRemember kid, not all grown-ups or managers behave this way, and it\u2019s against the law to steal or misuse your school money or pay.

It's mainly done by smart and sneaky folks working in big businesses (white-collar workers), and it often involves:\n\n1. Dirty money (dirty because it's from somewhere bad)\n2. Piggybacking (attaching dirty money to clean money)\n3. Mix and match (mixing clean and dirty money together)\n4. The journey (secretly moving money around)\n\nImagine you want to make dirty money look clean, here's how this \"mad magician\" might trick the number-crunchers:\n\nStage 1: Piggybacking (Attach dirty money to clean money)\nIn a dollar store, they deliberately overpay for an item\u2014let's say they paid much more for 5 packs of stickers than the regular price. They can hide their dirty money in the extra cash they use to pay. You can't tell who's money is dirty and who's clean!\n\nStage 2: Mixing and matching (Mix clean and dirty money)\nNow, imagine that person is window shopping and pays with our overpaying money.

So, the store clerk thinks the person is paying correctly with clean cash, but the dirty money is now hidden!\n\nStage 3: Secret journey (Secretly moving money around)\nHere comes the most tricky part. The \"magician\" takes these blended pieces of clean and dirty money to other places, like a store or bank, and so on, just like moving around dollar store things. This journey makes it super hard to trace where the dirty money came from and where it's really going!\n\nBy the time they're done wrestling with money,"}

They set a limit on the number of people (or customers) who can watch their shows at the same time because their machines (like digital players) can only show the show to a certain number of people at one time. If too many people wanted to watch at once, the race (or TV show) would be delayed for everyone.\n\nThe stations still want everyone to watch their shows. That way, they get donuts, trucks, or any toy car at the race! When more people watch, the station can show more ads (like donut placement) and make more money from the donuts (or ad money). This helps them stay electric and make more toys for everyone. So even limiting streaming is a way to make sure everybody gets to watch and enjoy the show (or race) together."}

There's no name given to the style of the painting (like you mentioned, not \"Impressionistic\"), because it's just that special. Many things make it famous:\n\n1. The woman in the painting is just so mysteriously calm and lovely to look at. People have been trying to figure out who she is and why she looks that way for a long time, adding to the painting's charm.\n\n2. The painting itself is very beautiful! It has lots of pretty colors and brilliant details, which make it not just a person, but a piece of art.\n\n3. Someone named Leonardo da Vinci, who was a very good artist and inventor back in his time, painted this. The world knows him as a famous guy, and because he made this painting, it also gets famous.\n\n4. This precious painting has been at a very important place called the Louvre museum in Paris, France for hundreds of years. That also makes it famous because people from all over pass by it and marvel at its beauty.\n\n5. The painting has made it to other movies, books, and stories, and people even try to replicate the style. Just like when your friends see something so cool and want to make or play like it.\n\n6. Visitors go from far away places just to see this painting. It becomes a reason for people to visit the city, almost like how a top-rated theme park attracts lots and lots of visitors.\n\nBut remember, fame is not about being the best; it's about being recognized by many others. Of course, there are many more beautiful paintings in the world, but Mona Lisa is just so special and loved by so many that it has gained its own fame. So, no, it's not \"overrated\" because it's loved by many \u2013 just like your friend Lisa, who has many unique things about her that"}

Explain like I'm five.", "input": "", "output": "Imagine American street names as a fun way to remember where you live or find a friend's house. Unlike in the UK, where you might name streets after kings and queens (like King Charles Street), most streets in America have interesting or unusual names for different reasons. Some streets might be named after important people (like George Washington) or famous events (like Lincoln Avenue), while others have pretty, quirky, or funny names.\n\nThink of street names like a game or code that makes each street special. Let's look at some of these cooler names you mentioned in your question:\n\n1. \"Raven\" could start a street! Maybe someone named their street after the famous black bird, or it could be just funny and unique!\n3. \"42nd\" and \"25th\" are like house numbers, but instead of just counting from left to right, Americans often number their streets starting from the top (like a chessboard), so if you're on the first row, your street is called \"42nd Street\" or \"25th Street.\"\n\nSo, now you know that American street names are unique and fun \u2013 they sometimes follow important people, big numbers, or things that make us tickle our funny bone. Next time, you'll be the one to explain it to your friends with the silly street names you see around!"}
{"instruction": "Medieval Nobility How did the system of nobility and peasanthood arise ? How did a family establish itself as ' noble ? ' What powers and responsibilities were granted to those of noble families ? Please explain like I'm five.", "input": "", "output": "Alright, little buddy, let's imagine we're time travelers heading all the way back to the Middle Ages. Imagine a big medieval village or kingdom. Now, everyone wasn't a knight or a princess, right? There were rich people (nobles) and poor people (peasants). Let's call them the 'big bosses' and 'hard-working folks'.\n\n1. The Rise of Nobility and Peasantry: Back in Medieval times, when the king couldn't watch every single person, he called the 'big bosses' to help him. These big bosses controlled the land, kept everyone safe, and collected taxes. As a result, they got special privileges and more rights than regular folks. That's when 'nobility' was born. On the other hand, the hard-working folks grew crops, made food, and had to pay taxes to the big bosses. So, their roles were like that of 'peasantry'.\n\n2. How to Become Noble: Become a noble was more like getting the privilege of your family being a 'big boss.' If your family had some lands and rights back in the day, you'd be considered a noble. These rights sometimes vanished for a while, but could return back (like a queen bee who's re-queened her hive). \n\n3. Powers and Responsibilities of Nobles: Picture a big family reunion. The 'big boss' has the biggest chair, makes most of the decisions, keeps everyone safe, and ensures that the other family members (like knights, and also the hard-working folks who work the land) have what they need. But remember, they also have some big responsibilities. They're supposed to protect their land, provide for their castle, and make fair decisions in family matters.\n\nJust remember, it wasn't always nice there. Sometimes, nobles used their power negatively, but that doesn't give us a full picture. The medieval world still has many lessons for us, showing how power, responsibility, and family wealth can shape a society."}

In our food world, fish and other meats are like these characters with their own special roles and rules.\n\nYou know how you love playing with the little fish toy, who leaps out of the water when frightened or happy? Fish, like little toy fish, have been living in water for a very long time. Their bodies and our bodies work a bit similar, which means the inside part (from the stomach till the body) cooks faster when heated. This is why we can eat fish without cooking it thoroughly, like sushi or sashimi.\n\nBut what about big animals like beef, chicken, and pork? Imagine they were tiny toys that never touched the water like the fish. For our bodies to use them effectively (just like we use toys to play a game), these meats from big animals need to cook to make the parts inside go soft (a process called denaturation). That's why, unlike our little fish friend, big animals need cooking to keep us safe.\n\nSometimes, different cooking methods can be like special tricks in a game and can help us understand that we don't need to cook big animal meats completely to make them delicious and safe. But still, we usually choose to cook them, just like your game characters have specific roles to play.\n\nIn summary, fish have a quick cooking time from inside to outside, like a tiny fish toy. Big animals take longer to cook inside, like a big and strong toy character who needs to be gentle to get going. It's just the way things are in the world of food and cooking!"}

Now, let's talk about the real soldiers during the Civil War, which happened a long time ago between the years 1861 to 1865 in the United States.\n\nDuring the Civil War, sometimes soldiers would line up and fire point blank (which means firing their real guns directly at each other without any distance between them) into each other's faces. Even though it sounds scary, the purpose was often to test if the rifles they had worked correctly and to see if they could hit their targets. It was also a sign of courage and bravery. \n\nRemember, these soldiers were not playing a game like you and your friends. They were real humans who fought in a war over important issues, such as whether some states in the United States should remain part of the country (these states wanted to keep having different things like slavery) or if they should become separate countries.\n\nSince that time, we've learned to solve problems in different ways, without resorting to violence like shooting at each other. We've come up with more peaceful ways to handle disagreements, and today we always try to avoid hurting people or being brave by fighting like that."}

This is like mixing our blue paint and yellow paint, and it creates green.\n\nNow, let's think about colorful rainbows and sunlight. Sunlight is made up of lots of tiny waves, like people standing next to each other. When we see white light coming from the sun, it's like many people holding hands. When a block (blue or yellow light) shines on them, it's like one person holding hands with another. The people together are now so tall they look like they must be white. This is like mixing our lights together, and it makes white light.\n\nSo, light and paint mix things differently because light is made up of super tiny waves and paints blend the colors together to make new colors. It's like being a painter that can mix tiny waves while the paint mixer can only mix the blocks."}

Now, let's say you have another smaller box with more of the same toys, but still some toys are too far away, and your friends aren't able to see all the details there either.\n\nIn the case of television and media cameras, the bigger camera allows the camera crew and filmmakers to see many more things happening at the same time and capture them all with details. For example, in a soccer game, the camera needs to be able to capture the players, the goal, and how they move and interact with each other. With a big camera, it can pick up all those details and show them to viewers on TV. \n\nNow, the extra camera on smaller devices you mentioned, like smartphones, is there to capture different things and different angles. For example, even though there are not as many details shown on the small screen when you're at a big event or movie, the ability to quickly take pictures or record videos from your phone is very helpful. Just think about when you want to take a selfie, record a fun moment, or document an exciting event and share what you saw with your family or friends.

First, when everyone is equal, it's hard to make sure everyone does their fair share of work. It's like when everybody in class gets the same grades even if some students studied harder than others. Mom and Dad might not feel motivated to work hard and earn more money because they might just end up getting the same amount as everyone else.\n\nSecondly, when nobody owns anything but the government does, people can become really unhappy because they don't feel in control of what they're doing or getting. It's kind of like if you and your friends were always told what toys to play with instead of choosing your own.\n\nLastly, big decisions, like where we build schools or hospitals, are made by the government, and that can be difficult because the government might not know the best thing to do for individual families or different people in the country.\n\nRemember, this explanation isn't saying whether it's good or bad overall.

They set up a rule called Prohibition (this means making something illegal) which started in 1920 and lasted until 1933.

Now, you mentioned it's used for calculating interests, but there's a bit of confusion here. Euler's number is not used directly to calculate interest; it's a more general-purpose number, especially in the world of compound interest calculations over time or in certain types of calculus problems, like continuously compounding interest.\n\nImagine you have a piggy bank, and it grows more money every day because of interest. If that interest is growing at a constant rate (like in standing on your toes), no matter how much money is in the piggy bank, it adds the same amount every day. That's compound interest with a fixed rate.\n\nBut let's say the piggy bank magic got even smarter; it could use extra money from previous days to make more money even sooner than expected, like using yesterday's extra money to earn interest today! That's what mathematicians call \"continuous compounding.\" Euler's number is the secret to this magic trick.\n\nThe constant isn't special for growing the piggy bank; it's also there because math needs constants. Constants are fixed, unchanging numbers that appear in equations. They help calculate things like speed (in miles or kilometers), how fast something falls (gravity), and in this case, piggy bank interest-growing!\n\nYou can see how this can be intimidating, but let's simplify. Euler's number isn't just about interest\u2014it's more about helping math make precise predictions, like projecting how high you'll bounce a ball or how fast a speeding car will travel. It's the \"how much\" in math's math. Think of it as the \"how much\" for everything that grows or changes\u2014even if you're not aiming for a higher piggy bank but still curious about the world!\n\nMath doesn't have to be scary or complicated.

Your body thinks it needs it to keep working properly, so it starts to react. This reaction is what we call alcohol withdrawal.\n\nThe withdrawal symptoms can feel uncomfortable and sometimes scary because your body is used to the bug's effects. From shaking and nausea to, in rare cases, much more serious symptoms like seizures or even risking a heart attack. It's like the space ship saying, \"Hey! The bug is gone, and frankly, I'm not ready to power down!\"\n \nIf these symptoms get severe, or neglected, it can become extremely dangerous and possibly fatal. It's important to remember that withdrawal from alcohol, like with any other substance, needs to be managed safely and by healthcare professionals. \nRemember, you don't have to navigate your star trek alone. Seek help if you need it."}

Explain like I'm five.", "input": "", "output": "Alright kiddo, imagine you have two kinds of toys that share the same box and strings (the speaker). \n\nOne kind of toy is an old one, let's call it the LP (it stands for \"long-play\"). The other is a new toy, like a CD (it stands for \"compact disc\").\n\nNow, imagine if you have a special circle (record player) for the old toy to play from, spinning slowly. As the special circle (record) starts to move, a stick (pick-up arm) sticks to it. As the stick moves, it makes the box and strings dance (create sound). This same stick sticks to the circle and makes the strings dance in a specific way. The different movements of the stick on the special circle (grooves) create unique sounds. \n\nNow imagining the CD toy. The special circle (CD) will spin quite fast since it's much smaller, and it has a different way of dancing the box and strings. It makes the strings dance without going up and down like the toy LP. \n\nSo, you see, even though the box and strings are the same for each toy, they play and dance in different ways. That's why some people say the old toy sounds different than the new one, while they're playing the same music on the same toy box and strings. Kids, that's all!"}

These places can be called Pubs or Bars. They're both similar, but they have different things going on inside.\n\nA Pub, like The King's Tavern, or The Rusty Hook, is a cozy, friendly place where you can grab a hot meal like chicken nuggets or hamburgers, and lots of drinks. People mostly spend time chatting, laughing, and enjoying the scrumptious food here. Buses and taxis stand outside because there's no special parking for cars. The name of these awesome spots usually comes from a cool or important personal or town-related story or grimy old pubs like The Crawling Rat or Dickens's Birthcutts.\n\nA Bar, on the other hand, like The Swinging Gin & Tillom Grin, is a place that's all about drinking cool beverages, dancing, and sometimes music. It's cool to stand and enjoy your drinks, instead of needing little tables and chairs to sit around. Food is not what gets served first - think more snacks or small meals to pair with the drinks. Sometimes, bars even have a bowling alley where you can knock down pins to stay on the move and maybe impress your friends.\n\nGetting back to those similar names, you know how you might borrow your teacher's colorful marker so you can write a lovely rainbow drawing, but at the end, your drawing looks like a little version of your teacher's? That's pretty much why pubs have similar names sometimes. People love to use names that sound familiar and charming, just like how they borrow ideas, and give them their own fun twist. So, The Coded Drum, and The Drumming Code, for instance, might be best friends in the city!"}
{"instruction": "How do messenger birds work ? I was watching game of thrones just now , and I got . to wondering about the ravens . I mean , is it even a thing ? How div they know where to go ? Please explain like I'm five.", "input": "", "output": "Messenger birds, like the ravens in \"Game of Thrones,\" are actually a real thing! They can help people communicate over long distances by carrying messages on their backs. While they still exist today (usually in places like ancient Egypt), they are not common anymore because we have other ways to communicate, like phones or computers. Here's how they work:\n\n1. Training: Messenger birds need to be trained so they know which messages they should carry. Training involves teaching the birds how to pick up and carry an object (like a tiny scroll wrapped around a stick).\n\n2. Signal: When someone wants to send a message, they prepare a small scroll or note (written on light material) with the information that needs to be passed along. They then attach it to a special stick, like a breadcrumb would be a tool for birds to carry food.\n\n3. The bird flies: The trained messenger bird carries the message, flying from one place to another. The bird might even memorize the route or follow specific landmarks along the way.\n\n4. Delivering the message: Once the bird reaches its destination, the person waiting for the message hangs up a special bowl (called a \"greeting tube\") near where the bird lands. The bird, remembering this location, flies away when he sees an object near the bowl \u2013 and drops the message right where the person by the bowl can reach it.\n\nSo, in short, messenger birds help people send messages by flying along a route, carrying a tiny scroll or note, and delivering it to the recipient's location! They may not know where to go because they remember a special signal (like where a greeting tube is placed), but their message-carrying atlas lives on internationally."}

Explain like I'm five.", "input": "", "output": "Imagine you're at a playground with a big toy pyramid. Each level of the pyramid has more toys than the one above. Here's how it might work:\n\n1. At the bottom, there's an adult (the director) who has a lot of special toys. These toys are expensive and not many people can buy them.\n\n2. The director asks their friends if they'd like to help them sell those toys.\n\n3. If their friends say yes, the director gives them some special coins (like \"shares\" in a real pyramid scheme) and tells them to invite more people to create the next level of the pyramid.\n\n4. These friends (now members) then make more friends who also join in and get some special coins, too.\n\n5. As more and more people join, more friends get coins, and at each level, not only is the number of toys going up, also the number of people with coins on each level keeps growing.\n\n6. The scheme works well as long as everyone keeps asking new people to join. But, when the bottom level of the pyramid gets full, and there's no new chance to ask people to join after that, the pyramid starts to collapse.\n\n7. The problem with pyramid schemes is that, eventually, there won't be enough regular folks to buy toys, and since only the top group (the director and a few friends) actually own the toys, everyone at the bottom will lose their special coins.\n\nLike any jungle game, it looks great at the start when only a few people are playing. However, once the fun and excitement run out, the game might not work at all. It's kind of like playing a game of tag where everybody is trying to tag each other, but only a few of you really have the okay to be \"it.\" In the end, not everyone can stay \"it,\" and if too many people need to run for cover at the same time, the game ends. \n\nNow, always remember that pyramid schemes are a type of trick, and it's best to talk to parents or teachers if someone ever invites you to join them.

This made some smart folks think they could sell Beanie Babies and make a lot of money, just like when you can sell candy for a lot more than what you've paid for it.\n\nSo everyone, including some grown-ups, started buying lots of them to sell. It's like when there are only five ice cream cones at a party, and everyone knows about it, and they still want one because it's fun to have!\n\nThen, these grown-ups would tell their friends and family about it, and more and more people got interested. They'd say things like, hey, I've got so many Beanie Babies, I think I can make a pretty penny - which just means they can buy a lot of things they like with that money. \n\nThis excitement and interest is what made people think that they too could make money like celebrities or professional sports players - Oh! But remember, just like in a game of musical chairs, eventually the music stops because there are not enough chairs (or Beanie Babies) for everyone. This hard part of Beanie Babies' popularity is called 'market saturation'. The '90s caught this, but because not everyone knew about the trick, some people made money before others, but most lost money when everyone realized there were only so many Beanie Babies available. \n\nJust remember, making money out of passing trends like this can be risky, and happy kids are wiser than the King Simon of Beanie Baby Market. The fun is in playing with Beanie Babies, loving them because they're cute, not thinking they're a smart business venture."}

This small part of the universe started exploding outwards like a huge balloon getting inflated, and as it expanded, it got cooler. This process is like the first second after your toy's first scream when it pops and starts making all sounds, and then quietens down as it gets bigger.\n\nNot only did all this matter (everything) shoot outwards from this special spot like toy trucks being thrown (annexed from space), but so did tiny bits of energy, light, and other invisible particles, that started to form causes of future 'explosions' - like never-ending zaoras.\n\nHere's the tricky part: where did all the little pieces that threw the first explosion and started creating more explosions and everything originate in?

Taxes (Birthday Shares): When each kid (or taxpayer) takes part of their allowance money (tax money), the exact amount depends on which team is in control. Democrats usually say parents (people) with more money should give more money to the playground (government), while Republicans argue that parents with less money shouldn't pay as much.\n\n3. Helping Other Children (Foreign Aid): Democrats think it's important to help playground kids who might have less toys and sweets (helping international poor countries). In contrast, Republicans believe America should focus on taking care of its own kids (national affairs) first before helping others.\n\n4. Business Play: When it comes to sharing toys (or business regulations) and organizing games (business environment), Democrats and Republicans often have different ideas.

How are paintings and artworks appraised?\n\nAppraising artwork sounds a little fancy, but it's really just like how you might want to know how much your favorite toy or game is worth. An appraiser is a person who looks closely at an artwork (like a time machine that looks at how and when it was made, who made it, and what materials were used) to figure out how much it's worth. \n\nThere are two main reasons they might look at something:\n    a. Estate Appraisals: This is for when a person passes away, and someone needs to know how much a collection of artwork in their house is worth.\n    b. Collection Appraisals: This is more like looking at a big box of many different kinds of artworks to see how much the whole box might be worth. And sometimes, it's to know how much a piece of artwork is worth at a store or as a gift swaps.\n\nAppraisers need to be really good at looking at details and using knowledge about art styles, history, and artist's reputation.\n\n2. What makes some contemporary artworks more valuable than another?\n\nThat's a great question! Imagine your old LEGO sets you donated for a good cause - some are really rare, right? Similarly, artists are like special LEGO blocks. Some are super rare or have a charming story (their style, the period when they made art), or the people who really love this artist's stuff find it super special. When many people love and talk about that LEGO set (or in case of art, the artwork), it becomes even more special.\n\n3. Can an artist knowingly influence the value of his work ?\n\nWell, if you think about it like a pizza topping - only those who like pepperoni can call it 'pepperoni topping' - artists aim for creating something that will be loved or talked about. So, if they are really good at deciding what might be popular, they 'may' be able to make certain artworks more valuable. But the truth is, no one really does this on purpose. Artists usually aim to create what they love while potentially making it appeal to more people.\n\nI hope this makes it all clear for"}

But why have people started talking about Fergusson's situation in terms of race?\n\nBecause the people talking about are trying to understand Fergusson better. They want to understand his life like six little factors: where he was from, what he believed in, who he was close to, how he was treated by the grown-ups around him, the jobs he could do, and the neighborhood he lived in. These details might show how Fergusson's life might have been different than other people's.\n\nSometimes, when a person is different from most people, they might not get a fair chance to do better things in life. It's not right, but some people's lives are affected by this unfairness, and they have to work harder to succeed. It's like trying to walk on a slippery floor while others walk on a solid one.\n\nIn Fergusson's situation, people are looking at these six factors to understand his life better, this includes the color of his skin. But remember, skin color doesn't tell the whole story about who a person is! Just like you're unique and special with your favorite color, everyone deserves a chance to be understood well, and to have roads less slippery to walk on."}

Everyone loves their color, right?\n\nNow, some people in both groups like playing games better than talking, while others like a mix of both. They might like building blocks more, or pretending as farmers, or cooking up pretend food together.\n\nIn this game park, we can call the friends who like playing games from all the color teams as either 'Radicals'. They want lots of fun games, but they don't split the playground into green and blue.\n\nThe buddies from both teams who like a combo of games and talks, let's name them 'Middle-Pawns'. They're not in the middle, they're more on the wheel in the sandbox. These are important people because they listen to everyone and keep the playground fun for all, without picking sides.\n\nAnd there you go. This playground has two big teams (Republicans, Democrats), but within those teams there are superheroes and peacekeepers who help make sure we all have a good time. Just like in real life, countries have big teams (parties) but within those, there are everyone and everyone's important!"}
{"instruction": "What exactly is an Arduino and how does it work ? Also , why is it used in what seems to be 90 % of home - made electronics projects ? Explain like I'm five.", "input": "", "output": "Okay kiddo, let's think about building a toy robot or remote control car with lots of neat buttons, lights, and maybe even music. The Arduino is like a smart brain for your toy that tells it what to do.\n\n\nImagine you have a robot. You want it to move, or maybe light up its head. How do you control it? You use remote controls, right? Well, Arduino works sort of like your remote control for electronics. Here's how:\n\n\n1. **Smart Brain (Arduino Board):** The Arduino board is like the smart brain of your toy. It has special circuits that can read the buttons you press or the signals you give, like instructions.\n\n\n2. **Talking Line (Cable):** You plug in your remote with a cable into the Arduino, just like plugging in a video game controller to get control over it.\n\n\n3. **Fun Button (Buttons or Sensors):** On your toy, these are like the buttons on your remote or the sensors that tell your Arduino when to make the toy light up or move.\n\n\n4. **Secret Code (Code in Programming Language):** To make your toy do awesome stuff, you write a special set of instructions for the Arduino. It uses a language called \"C++\" or can even use something called \"Python\" which is easier, like instructions to make the robot stop, play music, or turn lights on and off.\n\n\n5. **Create and Share (Printing to a Monitor or LED):** Finally, the Arduino makes your toy show what it's doing - like when you see the lights dancing on a robot or hear music played by the toy. \n\n\nWhy do they love Arduino? Well, it\u2019s super simple to set up and use, it's not expensive, and there's tons of other people who have used it before, so you can learn from their ideas and even sell your creations to others. Plus, it's the go-to gadget for makers who love to build and tinker, just like you with your toy cars and robots!"}

Explain like I'm five.", "input": "", "output": "When explaining to a five-year-old, imagine the universe is like a giant cosmic beach filled with an infinite amount of space, shining stars, swirling galaxies, and playful planets. It's like a vast, never-ending space ocean where each star is like a sparkling firefly and each planet is a dancing ice cream on a sunny day. This cosmic beach is so big that even if you could travel there on a super-fast rocket, you\u2019d still have more space to swim than all the beaches on Earth combined. The universe isn't a collection of small, fuzzy dots like a scattered sponge on the bathroom wall, but rather a gigantic ocean where all the little spots of water (stars and planets) are buoyant in the vastness of space."}
{"instruction": "LI5 : explain cancer . and one 's * realistic * chances of survival In tribute to : URL_0 . Sad stuff . EDIT : Also : why have n't we cured it yet ? Explain like I'm five.", "input": "", "output": "Alright, kiddo. Imagine your body is like a big city where every house is a cell. Cells are part of your body and they work together to keep you healthy. Just like cities have rules, cells also have rules. They grow and divide to create new cells when the body needs them, like when you're growing.\n\nNow, cancer is like rogue agents (bad cells) who start working against the rules. These bad cells don't follow the same rules as other cells and start growing and dividing quickly without stopping. They create a big mess, like a group of monsters taking over a part of the city. This mess is called a tumor.\n\nNow, you might think solving the problem of these rogue agents (cure the cancer) would be as easy as calling the police (doctors). Well, it does get a little tricky. There are billions and billions of cells in your body, and only a few are rogue agents. Doctors and scientists make big efforts to catch these rogue agents and remove them. However, sometimes the rogue agents are so many and they have spread to other parts of the city (the body), which makes it hard to remove them all. \n\nAlso, it's important to remember everyone's chances are different when facing rogue agents. Some people may need action right away, like a big police force to remove them, while others may need a watchful eye. This depends on your case.\n\nThe truth is, we haven't 'cured' cancer yet because it's a big city problem for our body, and it's hard to solve. The rogue agents are good at hiding, and sometimes they can be very cunning. Nonetheless, doctors and scientists are working hard every day to find better ways to catch these rogue agents and keep us protected. So, be happy, brave, and stay healthy!"}

Explain like I'm five.", "input": "", "output": "Okay, imagine taxes as when you earn a certain amount of money, you have to share a bit with the government, kind of like when you have a pizza and you share a piece with everyone at the table. Americans tend to not like giving as much as they could because they think it's like giving up all their pizza.\n\nOn the other hand, people in Canada, who are just a little bit to the north (yet not really, they're still in America), give a bit more of their pizza away, but in the end, they usually get more than Americans do. This is because the Canadian government uses that money to make the land we live in more beautiful and nice to visit, like building parks, museums, and making sure the weather is okay when we play outside.\n\nSo, it's not that Canadians are mean, they're just trying to make sure everyone, including them, can enjoy playing and living in their land even more together!"}
{"instruction": "How does compressing and uncompressing data work ? How does it not lose any information ? For instance if you compress something into a zip file , how do you not lose all of the data ? Please explain like I'm five.", "input": "", "output": "Alright, imagine you have a bunch of Lego blocks with different shapes and sizes (representing your data). But you're really good at rearranging these blocks without losing anything (that's like zip file compression). Here's how it works:\n\n1. **Looking for patterns**: Before you compress your Lego blocks (data), start by looking for repeated shapes or colors. You want to find blocks that are really similar or the same.\n\n2. **Placing like blocks together**: Once you find these similar blocks, you line them up together instead of scattering them around. You also write a little description (recipe), telling anyone how to put these pieces back together. You might only need a tiny piece of paper for this description.\n\n3. **Making things smaller**: When you lump similar blocks together and keep the short description, it takes less space (or social time for your friends to understand how to recreate each Lego shape) than if you kept each shape individually with its own big manila folder (that's the original uncompressed data).\n\n4. **Unrolling the pattern**: If you want to see your original Lego creation (get your data back), you just follow the little recipes you made earlier. You put all the similar blocks back where they belong, and voil\u00e0! You have the original design back, with no pieces missing.\n\n5. **Automatic backtick:** There are automated machines (like smart software) that do this whole blocking, grouping, and recipe writing process very quickly for tons of different Lego pieces. They're called compressors and decompressors, respectively.\n\nSo, just like you don't lose any Lego pieces when you rebuild your design using the little instructions, zip files don't lose any of the data when you decompress them. The data is all there, just arranged in a more compact and efficient way before it's sent or stored."}
{"instruction": "can someone explain how a programing language can control a machine Like how does a command actually make something physically happen ?

Imagine you want to tell your toy robot to safely cross the table so you can move it aside. You would give the toy robot a simple instruction like \"move left.\" Now, think of the programming language as a special kind of recipe book.\n\nWhen we write code in a programming language, we're giving the robot a list of steps to follow to complete a mission, just like the recipe guides your cooking adventure. These steps are not written in just any words; they are written following very structured rules (those are the programming language's \"syntax\").\n\nPicture a robot as a puzzle master, but instead of puzzle pieces, it understands written words and numbers (this is the programming language's \"compiler\" at work). The small puzzle pieces (or data) are put into the right pattern by translating them into a specific sequence of moves and commands. Once the pattern is formed, the robot can do its thing!\n\nMost of the time, when we \"run\" our robot, a computer (also known as a \"compiler\") reads our program and translates it into instructions that the robot's own system understands. This process is called \"compilation.\" These translated instructions might tell the robot's motor to turn, its wheels to move, or its sensors to do things like avoid obstacles.\n\nIn essence, the way we talk to our robot (like \"move right\" or \"stop\") is translated into its language via a special one-way stop sign. When the robot hears our command, it knows exactly what to do. Voila! The robot's actions match the message fixed into the electronic network!"}
{"instruction": "Libertarians so a volunteer at an anarchist bookstore told me that libertarianism is \" socialism for rich people \" and I have my doubts . What is libertarianism ? What kind of person would be into it ? How would a libertarian society function ? Please explain like I'm five.", "input": "", "output": "Hello there! Let's dive into the world of libertarianism in a simple way.\n\nImagine if you had a big toy box at home that was full of cool toys, games, and fun stuff. You could do whatever you wanted with your box of toys, as long as you didn't take toys from someone else's box without asking or stealing them.\n\nLibertarianism is like having a big playground. In this playground, people are like kids with their own big toy box at home. Libertarians believe that everyone should have the freedom to use their box (which is like a person's personal things like their money, property, and opinions) without someone else telling them what to do with it.\n\nNow, you might have heard the words \"socialism\" and \"anarchists\" when talking about libertarianism. Some people might say that socialism for rich people means that rich people would get all the toys, and it wouldn't be very fair for everyone else. Anarchists are like the kids who believe that there should be no one in charge, and everyone can just play and have fun.\n\nHere's who might like being into libertarianism:\n1. The responsible kids in their families - Parents or guardians who are good at teaching kids about sharing, but don't want someone else deciding what's fair.\n2. Kids who want to be able to choose what they want to do with their toys - They don't want someone to take their favorite toys away without asking.\n3. Kids who believe everyone should have the chance to use their toys in their own unique way - Freedom for everyone to play and be creative.\n4. Kids who want to work hard and earn more toys - Instead of getting everything handed to them, they think they should have control over their actions and the rewards.\n\nSo, how does a libertarian society work?\nImagine if you have a big toy playground with kids coming together to play without any parks rangers telling them what to do. Everyone gets care packages with little toys, but it's up to them to decide how to use them. Kids might trade their toys and create their own clubs and games, sharing and helping out whenever they like. The goal is to let everyone be"}
{"instruction": "Why ca n't we make a dinosaur like in Jurassic Park ? bingo ! dino dna !

That's why we can't find their DNA recipe anymore, because it has been well over 65 million years!\n\nIn the movie \"Jurassic Park,\" grown-ups used some dino DNA left behind by their fossils (like a toy made by an old master) and mixed it with other living animals' DNA, often from a tiny feathered creature called an \"ember dodo.\" They also used a magical machine to help grow a real, or \"alive,\" dinosaur. This magical machine is called \"cloning.\" But unfortunately, mommy dinosaurs weren't around to assist with this complicated science.\n\nSo, even though scientists can study dinosaur DNA by looking at their fossils, it's much harder to use those DNA pieces to bring dinosaurs back to life. It's sort of like trying to build a toy car without its blueprint. You might be able to guess what is inside but can't make a whole new one from scratch.\n\nThis is why scientists always remember, things, like dinosaurs, are not really missing; they just lived on a planet much, much different from the one we're on today."}
