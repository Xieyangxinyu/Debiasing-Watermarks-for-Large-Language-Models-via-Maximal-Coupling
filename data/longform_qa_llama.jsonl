Please explain like I'm five.", "input": "", "output": "I think it's kind of a bad idea to use an IQ test to make decisions about a person's future. First of all, you have to have a very good test to get a good score, and I think it's pretty hard to do that.

However, the test can give you an idea of how much your parents might be able to help you in the future. Second, IQ scores don't predict very well if you look at just one test, or even a group of tests. So, it's better to look at the results of several tests and combine them together to get an idea of the person's overall IQ.

This currency was not widely accepted, and Russian manufacturers couldn't buy Ukrainian oil at the price it should have been bought, so the economy fell into a recession. Russia was a major importer of Ukrainian oil, so as the Ukraine tried to push their own currency, Russia had to protect its own currency, and Russia 's economy collapsed.

The Swiss National Bank has decided to peg the Swiss franc to the euro and keep its exchange rate from fluctuating. The exchange rate has changed from 1.20 to the euro to 1.15. The change has led to questions about the stability of the Swiss economy. The Swiss government is considering ways to protect the Swiss economy from the impact of a falling franc. </p>\n\n### Feedback:\n\n### Explanation:\n\nThe 1.20 to 1.15 exchange rate reflects a 13% decrease in the value of the Swiss franc. The Swiss National Bank has decided to peg the Swiss franc to the euro. This means that the Swiss franc will remain at its current value, regardless of how the exchange rate fluctuates. This policy has been in effect since 2009 and has helped keep the value of the Swiss franc stable.\n\nThe Swiss government is considering ways to protect the Swiss economy from the impact of a falling franc. One option is to allow the Swiss franc to float freely, which would result"}

Please explain like I'm five.", "input": "", "output": "\nThis is not possible because this would require you to compromise the security of each of the networks. For example, if your neighbour's network was secured with WEP, then you would need to decrypt their WEP key in order to access their network. Once you knew their password, you would then be able to access your neighbour's network. It would be similar if you knew the password to both your neighbour's WPA network and your own WPA network.\n\nIn order to do this, you would need to be able to decrypt the WPA key of your neighbour's network. You would then need to be able to access the WPA key of your own network in order to decrypt your neighbour's WPA key. As you can see, this could be very difficult to do. If you are able to do this, then you could probably access all of your neighbour's networks without them knowing.\n\nAs you can see, this would be a very bad idea.

{"instruction": "how does a nuclear reactor work ? Including how it starts up and maintains stability to how its energy get stored . Please explain like I'm five.", "input": "", "output": "A nuclear reactor uses Uranium and other materials to produce energy. Uranium, a naturally occurring element, is found in nature. It is composed of atoms that have an atom of Uranium in the center with a tail of other elements that have more positive or negative electrons. The atom's nucleus has an equal number of protons and electrons (the nucleus is an atom's center). Because of the Uranium atom's electrical charge, it is unstable. This electrical charge can also be used to create power.\n\nWhen Uranium atoms are combined, the atoms lose their extra electrons and become stable. Uranium atoms that lose their extra electrons are called Uranium isotopes. To create energy, the Uranium atoms are split and release energy.\n\nNuclear energy is produced by Uranium that has lost its extra electrons. This Uranium isotope is called Uranium dioxide (UO2). When Uranium dioxide is split, energy is released.\n\nNuclear energy is also produced by Uranium that has not lost its extra electrons. This Uranium isotope is called Uranium"}
{"instruction": "Can someone explain why currencies move up and down ? And more specifically why the British Pound and the Euro rarely move these days . Explain like I'm five.", "input": "", "output": "I'm going to use the same currency pair in the question to explain the movement of the currencies. First, I'll explain what an exchange rate is. An exchange rate is the price of one currency divided by the price of another. This helps you to understand why currencies move. If the British Pound buys more Euros than the Euro buys British Pounds, the Pound will increase in value and the Euros will decrease in value. This is because of what is called supply and demand. When there is more demand for a currency than supply, the value of that currency will increase. If there is more supply for a currency than demand, the value of that currency will decrease.\n\nIn order for the demand and supply to be balanced, the value of currencies must change. This is done by either printing more or less of the currency. For example, if the supply of Euros exceeds the demand for Euros, the central bank will print more Euros. This will increase the price of Euros and cause the value of the Euro to decrease. This is a common thing that happens in the real world. We have seen that when the demand for a good exceeds the supply of the good, the value of"}

For either of these options , why ? Explain like I'm five.", "input": "", "output": "Time dilation is the effect where things happen slower when you're moving at higher speeds. You experience less time as you move slower because of your body's limited ability to process the information as you move.\n\n### Explanation:\nOne example of this would be if you're in a car driving faster than the speed limit. You're moving more than you can process at a high rate, so you don't get to experience as many moments of your life. For example, if you're a tenth of a second slower, you would experience the same amount of time as if you had actually slowed down to 5 mph.\n\n### Why does this happen ?\n\nThis is because your brain can't process as much information as you're trying to.

Please explain like I'm five.", "input": "", "output": "Blockchain ledgers are not tracked or even consolidated, as a single ledger is redundant, but the tracking can be done using other techniques, such as tamper-resistant signatures on contracts and contracts that are enforced by smart contracts on the blockchain. This is done in many ways. Most importantly, in many countries it is illegal to counterfeit currency. For example, in the United States, money in circulation is maintained by the Federal Reserve Banks, which then verify it by cross checking the signatures on it. In the United Kingdom, the Money Laws Act of 2012 requires that all bank notes issued by the Bank of England must be marked with a watermark and be signed with an embossed signature. The watermark and signature must match the details of the bank note before it can be used. In the United States, most bank notes are also printed with a serial number, which is checked by the Federal Reserve against their records.

Content that is offensive or inappropriate is removed to protect the community. This means that the moderators have the right to decide what's appropriate and what's not.\n\nSecond, the user can think about the concept of distance. It's possible that the content wasn't visible because the user didn't scroll down far enough. It's also possible that the user doesn't know what's in the content, or the content isn't relevant to them.

I tried to find an answer on google and found plenty on what the symptoms are , but could n't really find anything on why this is the case . Please explain like I'm five.", "input": "", "output": "The withdrawal of alcohol is not only extremely intense but potentially fatal because it can cause a drastic drop in blood pressure. The level of alcohol in the body is not as constant as it is in food because we do not have a steady source of alcohol to digest in our stomachs. When alcohol is ingested, it enters the bloodstream and travels to the liver where it is broken down and metabolized. If alcohol is in excessive amounts and left unchecked, it can cause a dangerous drop in blood pressure. This condition is called hypoxia, which means a lack of oxygen.\n\n### Explanation:\nAlcohol is known to be a depressant, which means it slows down the nervous system. When we are under the influence of alcohol, it is normal to feel drowsy and to experience a decrease in our mental and physical ability. This slowing of the nervous system is what can lead to hypoxia, or a lack of oxygen. The drop in blood pressure, therefore, can be dangerous and even fatal.\n\n---\n\n### Instruction:\nOk, now for my explanation, I will"}
